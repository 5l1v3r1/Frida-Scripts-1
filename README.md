# process-hooker
 
Tested on Windows 10 with Frida 12.10.4

 - Started with [frida-wshook](https://github.com/OALabs/frida-wshook)
 - Removed the script specific stuff, and swapped it over to process tracing
 - Updated to be Python 3 compatible
 - Updated all the Frida JS to what I think is best practice/newest
 - Added a few more functions for observation
   
## Install & Setup 

 - Install Python 3.x  
 - Install the [Frida](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/frida) python bindings using pip 
```
pip install frida
```
 - Clone (or download) the frida-process repository.


# shellcode-analysis
 
No idea what I'm doing with this one. It doesn't work the way I want it to. You can use it,
it's mostly worthless.
